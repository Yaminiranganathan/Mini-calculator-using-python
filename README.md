Objective
The major objectives of the project are as follows:

  To provide a simple command-line calculator for basic arithmetic operations.
  To support multiple arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and floor division.
  To ensure ease of use with a straightforward user interface.
Existing System
  Users manually perform arithmetic calculations or use basic calculators.
  Data is often entered and processed manually without the flexibility of multiple operations in sequence.
  Users have to perform each operation individually and cannot easily chain calculations together.
Proposed System
  The proposed system automates the arithmetic calculation process with a command-line interface.
  By using Python functions, the system supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and floor division.
  The system handles user input efficiently and provides immediate results for each operation.
  Users can perform multiple operations sequentially and continue calculations based on previous results.
Features
  Addition: Allows users to add a list of numbers and get their sum.
  Subtraction: Supports the subtraction of a list of numbers sequentially.
  Multiplication: Enables the multiplication of a list of numbers to get their product.
  Division: Provides division of a list of numbers with error handling for division by zero.
  Floor Division: Performs floor division on a list of numbers with error handling for division by zero.
  Sequential Operations: Users can perform all the above operations in one go and continue further calculations as needed.
Future Enhancement
  The project can be expanded to include more advanced features such as power and modulus operations.
  Integration with a graphical user interface (GUI) to enhance user experience.
  Adding support for more complex mathematical functions and operations.
  Implementing a history feature to keep track of past calculations.
